This project focuses on collecting mobile phone data—such as price, brand, specifications, and features—using web scraping techniques. After extracting the data, it is cleaned, structured, and analyzed through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover meaningful insights. The analysis highlights pricing patterns, feature distributions, brand-wise comparisons, and relationships between specifications and cost. The project helps understand market trends, identify key factors influencing mobile prices, and support data-driven decision-making for consumers and businesses.
